Working when run should give a full computer report, places in C:\Users\Public
Watch out, because it deletes itself at the end. So if you don't save a copy you'll have to pull it again.
Advised to run by:
GUI r 
powershell Start-Process cmd -Verb runAs
> powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy 'Unrestricted' -Scope CurrentUser -Confirm:$false
> powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -File "path"    

Or just if you want to see what happens

> powershell.exe -File "path"

The first command may not work. The file is supposed to be in C:\Windows so that it can have certain permissions but seems to work fine when it is just run.
