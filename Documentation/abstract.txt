We address the problem of cyber security in small businesses and non-profits. By designing a cheap, non-invasive, and easy-to-use suite of security implements we help to allow smaller organizations safeguard their critical data and infrastructure. This approach allows companies to quickly find and fix discovered vulnerabilities. Small businesses do not have the capital to hire large security teams, instead they need an affordable kit that they can apply themselves. Other solutions may not fit the needs for small networks and may be cost-prohibitive. Because this product can be self-navigated, it provides a cheap solution for testing while also educating businesses about potential attack vectors. This kit can test for website vulnerabilities, man-in-the-middle attacks (both wired and wireless), physical security, and phishing. By using this product the business will be more secure than before.
